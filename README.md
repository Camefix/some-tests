This is, for now, just a personal project to try things with a python project.

If you want to try it yourself:

- download Python (I work with 3.83.3, but I don't think I use many new features)
- install pygame (I work with 1.9.6)
- run with the command "python -m src"

Here is a list of the different things you can do now:

Title screen:
On launch, a title screen appears on a blue background.
The title rises, and buttons appear. You can rotate between them with the arrows, and select some of them with the spacebar.
You have:
- the reset button that resets the title page.
- the quit button that closes the game.
- the battle button that launch a sample battle.

Battle mode:
For now, a map appear with a cursor on it. You can move it with the arrows in the grid.
The camera follows the cursor with delay. The cursor should end up in the middle of the screen, except if it is on the edge of the map.
