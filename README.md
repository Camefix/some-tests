This is, for now, just a personal project to try things with a python project.

If you want to try it yourself:

- download Python (I work with 3.83.3, but I don't think I use many new features)
- install pygame (I work with 1.9.6)
- run with the command "python -m src"

For now (with a bit of imagination):
- there is a title screen on a blue background
- the title rises, and 3 buttons appear
- with the arrows, you can rotate between 4 buttons
